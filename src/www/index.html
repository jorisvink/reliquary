<strong>Introduction</strong>
<span class="cross">+</span>
</span>
</p>

<p class="content">
The Reliquary is a <a href="https://sanctorum.se" target="_blank">sanctum</a>
cathedral infrastructure which helps you establish PQ-secure P2P E2EE sanctum
tunnels between any of your POSIX devices, even if they are behind NAT.
</p>

<p class="content">
The Reliquary provides an API which interacts with our cathedrals and allows
you to easily manage your flocks and devices using a handful of very
simple shell scripts.

<p class="content">
Reliquary is based on
<a href="https://github.com/jorisvink/sanctum/" target="_blank">sanctum</a>.
This daemon was designed from the ground up with strong privilege separation
and sandboxing.
</p>

<p class="content">
The sanctum daemon uses modern cryptography for traffic encryption
and features a hybridised key exchange mixing a symmetrical shared
secret, ECDH and ML-KM-1024 together to provide strong PQ-security
guarantees for the confidentiality and integrity of your traffic.
</p>

<p class="content">
A more detailed cryptographic description can be found in the sanctum
repository inside of the <a href="https://github.com/jorisvink/sanctum/blob/master/docs/crypto.md" target="_blank">docs/crypto.md</a> file.
</a>

<p class="content">
You are not limited to just sanctum, any
<a href="https://github.com/jorisvink/libkyrka" target="_blank">libkyrka</a>
application can also leverage this infrastructure. For example the
following sanctum based applications work out of the box:
<a href="https://github.com/jorisvink/tier6" target="_blank">tier6</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/jorisvink/confessions" target="_blank">confessions</a>

<strong>The Cathedrals</strong>
<span class="cross">+</span>
</span>
</p>

<p class="content">
We use the
<a href="https://github.com/jorisvink/sanctum/blob/master/docs/cathedral.md"
target="_blank">cathedral mode</a> of sanctum to provide an authenticated relay
and a key distribution point. The authenticated relay is used for peer
discovery and will facilitate the peer-to-peer connections if possible.
</p>

<p class="content">
As a key distribution point, the cathedrals allow you to update your
shared secrets for your devices.
</p>

<p class="content">
<span class="notice">Important</span>: These are always wrapped with
your per-device unique KEK and we do not see the plaintext keys.
</p>

<p class="content">
The Reliquary provides multiple cathedrals to provide resilience in the
case of an outage or if cathedrals drop offline unexpectedly.

<strong>Do you have access to my traffic?</strong>
<span class="cross">+</span>
</span>
</p>

<p class="content">
No.
</p>

<p class="content">
The cathedrals cannot inject, modify or read any of your traffic
that is relayed over them because they lack the keys to be able
to do so, you own those keys.
</p>

<p class="content">
A cathedral is only involved for a few seconds while the p2p discovery
kicks in, or relays traffic if no p2p connections are possible.

<strong>Can I just build this myself?</strong>
<span class="cross">+</span>
</span>
</p>

<p class="content">
Due to the fact that sanctum is truly open and free software licensed
under the ISC-license you are able to build something like this entirely
yourself. In fact we encourage you to do so if you have the know-how.
</p>

<p class="content">
You can find all code required to run reliquary.se on our github mirror
<a href="https://github.com/jorisvink/reliquary/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<strong>Who runs this?</strong>
<span class="cross">+</span>
</span>
</p>

<p class="content">
This community service is run by the creator of sanctum with the help
of a few volunteers from across the globe. The Reliquary was started
so that he and his protokol0x41 hacker friends could more easily
setup tunnels between all their devices without having
to use services like Tailscale or Zerotier.

<p class="content">
If one of your devices is behind a NAT type that prevents falling over

cathedrals (remember, we cannot read your traffic) and will be capped
at 25mbit/sec.
